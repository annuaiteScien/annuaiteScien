- 👋 Hi, I’m @annuaiteScien

👀 I’m interested in automating deployment processes, containerization technologies, and cloud computing. Passionate about improving infrastructure reliability and efficiency through DevOps practices.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Kubernetes management, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and exploring the capabilities of serverless architectures.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to DevOps tooling, particularly those focused on CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and system observability.

⚡ Fun fact: In my free time, I enjoy building IoT projects with Raspberry Pi and automating every possible aspect of my home. I also love mountain biking and coding small games.
